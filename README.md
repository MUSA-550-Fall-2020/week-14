# Week 14<br>Dashboarding with Panel and the Holoviz Ecosystem

## Final Project

The final deliverable **must include all three of the below items**:

1. a web-based data visualization with a URL (public or private)
1. a document describing the project, the results, and the technical methods used in each step (collection, analysis and visualization)
1. all code/spreadsheets/datasets used

The materials for steps #2 an #3 above should be submitted to your own specific GitHub repository, which can be created using the link below:

https://classroom.github.com/g/Ziyu_n2S

### Important

- The code for your web-based visualization (#1) can be either in the same repository or in a separate **public** repository. If it is in its own repository, be sure to link to it from the main, submission repository.
- Be sure to include the names of everyone who worked on the final project somewhere in the README, etc!

## Dashboard Examples

We'll walk through two examples of [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) dashboards that can serve as a reference for the final project.

1. [Visualizing recent shootings in Philadelphia using Altair, Folium, and Holoviews](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020/philadelphia-shootings-app)
1. [Visualizing NYC taxi trips with Datashader and Altair](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2020/datashader-nyc-taxi-app)
